# This uses the "anniversaries" integration from HACS.
# Without that installed, this particular file just raises errors.
# We !include this file in configuration.yaml, then tell it that the integration is to give us a sensor type.
# Each anniversary you can give a name, and could be something like a birthday reminder or an anniversary.
# If it's a one-time anniversary, I'd suggest configuring it via the web UI instead of through a YAML file - that's just easier.
