# This file is where I would store any entries I wish to reference in other files, securely.
# I would do this by assigning a name here, and a value.
# Then, in another config file, I would use "!secret name" to use the value from here.

# So if I had a file with:
config_item: !secret secret_detail

# I would need an entry here with the matching name, like so:

secret_detail: thisisthevaluetouse
