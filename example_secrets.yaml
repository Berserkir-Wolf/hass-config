# You can store any entries you wish to reference in other files in a file similar to this, named secrets.yaml
# Do this by assigning a name here, and a value.
# Then, in another config file, use "!secret name" to use the value from here.

# So, if a file had this in it:
config_item: !secret secret_detail

# It would need an entry in secrets.yaml with a matching name, like so:
secret_detail: thisisthevaluetouse
# This would then mean that the value used for "config_item" is, in face, "thisisthevaluetouse".

# This is especially useful for securing authentication details that you wish to keep safe.
